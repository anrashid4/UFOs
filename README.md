# UFO Sightings 

During this module challenge, we created a webpage in which we generated a significant amount of data in regards to UFO sightings. This data was then displayed on the webpage and to the left of the data, we created some filters. These filters include things such as date, city, and even shape. By adding these filters, our client can precisely find which exact UFO sighting they might be referring too, rather than having to dig through the large amounts of data. 

# Possible Improvements 

Some possible improvements to this project could be adding more evidence to support the UFO sighting such as images or anecdotes from those who claim they saw the UFO.
